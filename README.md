# GAN-Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection using Generative Adversarial Network


## Dataset
In this project, we use [NAB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/boltzmannbrain/nab) - Dataset, and scoring for detecting anomalies in streaming data.

There are over 50 labeled real-world and artificial timeseries data files plus a novel scoring mechanism for real-time applications.

From the present datasets, I picked up and analyzed **Twitter_volume_AAPL** from realTweets dataset. This dataset does not include actual anomaly point, so we need to refer to [NAB github repository](https://github.com/numenta/NAB/blob/master/labels/combined_windows.json)


## Goal of this project
